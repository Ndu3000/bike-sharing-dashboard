# Title: Optimizing Bike Sharing Operations through Data-Driven Insights

## Description:

The bike-sharing company, equipped with extensive historical ride data, aims to optimize its operations and enhance user experience. Leveraging cloud-based infrastructure, batch processing, and workflow orchestration tools, the goal is to develop a robust data engineering solution that transforms raw data into actionable insights. The solution will culminate in a dashboard providing intuitive visualizations for stakeholders to make informed decisions.

## Problem:
The bike-sharing company faces challenges in efficiently managing its fleet, stations, and user experience. These challenges include:

### Demand Forecasting:

Predicting ride demand across different time periods, stations, and user demographics to allocate resources effectively and anticipate potential service disruptions.

### User Behavior Analysis: 
Understanding user preferences, ride patterns, and factors influencing ridership to tailor marketing strategies, station placement, and pricing models.

### Operational Efficiency: 
Identifying inefficiencies in bike distribution, station maintenance, and service availability to optimize fleet management and reduce operational costs.

## Proposed Solution:
Develop a data engineering pipeline that encompasses the following components:

### Data Ingestion: 
Extract data from the "Divvy_trips_all_2013-2021" dataset stored in Google Cloud Storage (GCS) and load it into Google BigQuery for further processing.

### Data Transformation: 
Apply batch processing techniques using SQL queries within DBT to transform raw trip data into aggregated metrics such as ride counts, average trip duration, and popular routes.

### Workflow Orchestration: 
Utilize Mage AI for workflow orchestration to automate the data pipeline, ensuring timely execution of data transformations and updates.

### Data Analysis: 
Employ SQL queries within DBT to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and generate insights on ride demand, user behavior, and operational efficiency.

### Dashboard Creation: 
Utilize a Business Intelligence (BI) tool such as Data Studio to design an interactive dashboard. The dashboard will include:

- A graph showing the distribution of ride types (e.g., subscriber vs. customer) to understand user demographics and preferences.
- A temporal line graph illustrating ride frequency over time, allowing stakeholders to visualize trends and seasonality in ridership.

### Technology Stack:

- Cloud: Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Terraform
- Workflow Orchestration: Mage AI
- Data Warehouse: BigQuery
- Batch Processing: DBT - SQL
- Dashboard Tool: Data Studio

## Expected Outcome:

The developed dashboard will empower stakeholders, including operations managers, marketing teams, and city planners, to make data-driven decisions to optimize bike-sharing operations, enhance user experience, and drive business growth.
